    <p>There is a section of Hikkaduwa Beach where the beach forms a kind of point into the sea. There the water is especially shallow and the waves are very calm and flat. It is said that you can see sea turtles at this spot. Probably you can recognize this place by the fact that enthusiastic people are cavorting close to the water and all have their cell phones or cameras in their hands. At least that’s how we became aware of the turtles.

    </p>
    <p>Already a few minutes before we were pointed out by a local that a little further down the beach there are also turtles and we should look at them. Therefore, we already knew approximately where we had to go. When we arrived there, it was actually impossible to miss. Two families were standing with their feet in the water and everyone had their cell phones pointed at the water. We were led the last few feet to the turtles by another Sri Lankan.

        If I hadn’t known there were supposed to be turtles there, I probably would have just mistaken them for dark, round, large rocks in the water. Somehow I thought they were small turtles but these ones are really really big and resemble a rock. They are actually not that easy to find if you don’t know what to look for.</p>

         <p>The locals lured the two big turtles in the water to the beach by seaweed or algae and then also put some of this green stuff in my hand. They told me to feed the turtles with it and thus lure them even closer to shore. At first I was a bit skeptical but after several requests from the locals I finally went into the water with the kelp to feed one of the turtles. This also reacted immediately to the food and snatched cautiously after it.

            Unfortunately I can’t think of another description, because snatching sounds rather hectic, but she was really very careful.
            So I stood virtually from now on next to a huge, wild green sea turtle in the shallow water and am this feeding. It is so incredibly impressive and fascinating to be so close to these calm, relaxed creatures. The turtles seem to be familiar with humans and you don’t have to worry about them snapping at you. They are only interested in the kelp and even at this they are very careful. You can touch them on the shell, look at them up close and have a unique moment with them.

            <p>The turtle beach is very beautiful beach to visit and enjoy the sunset. there are giant turtles and people feed them and play with them.Also the water is very clear therefore you can see small fishes in the water .In the evening, the sky view is soo amazing and memmorable.  Recommend this beach to all who wants to relaxed your mind.</p>
