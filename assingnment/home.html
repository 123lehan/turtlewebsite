            <p class="sheesh">Sri Lanka is home to several species of turtles, including the Green Turtle, Olive Ridley Turtle, Hawksbill Turtle, Loggerhead Turtle, and Leatherback Turtle. These species of turtles are found in various locations around the island, including along the coast, in rivers, and in wetlands.The turtles in Sri Lanka face many threats to their survival, including habitat destruction, pollution, and illegal harvesting of their eggs and meat. Efforts have been made to protect these turtles and their habitats through conservation projects and awareness campaigns.</p>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Turtle watching is an amazing experience beyond explanation. Watching these calm and peaceful
                    critters in the sea, slowly swimming, looking for their next meal, or hauling themselves up to a
                    sandy beach for nesting - is something that is bound to be in your memory for a long time.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Depending on the season, Rekawa, Hikkaduwa, Mirissa, Kosgoda, Beruwala and Trincomalee can be
                    considered as the best places in the island to catch a glimpse of these great turtles… or maybe have
                    a swim with them, if you get lucky</li>
                <br>
                <li>Different species of sea turtles feed on different things, though most of them like jellyfish.
                    Leatherback sea turtles specialise in eating jellyfish which keeps the jellyfish population in
                    check. </li>
                <br>
                <li> They are also an important source of income for coastal residents through turtle-watching
                    ecotourism which is a major and an increasingly popular part of Sri Lanka tourism. </li>
                <br>
                <li>Research has shown that sea turtle ecotourism can generate three times the income, than by selling
                    sea turtle parts (eggs, meat and shells), making them worth more alive than dead.</li>
                <br>
                <li>There are seven known species of turtle, and five of these are found off the coast of Sri Lanka.
                    These are the Green turtle, Hawksbill turtle, Leatherback turtle, Loggerhead turtle and the Olive
                    Ridley turtle.</li>

            <p class="gihan">Turtles are fascinating reptiles that have been around for millions of years. One of the defining characteristics of turtles is their unique shell, which serves as their protective covering. The shell is made up of bones and cartilage, and it can vary in shape, size, and color depending on the species. Turtles are found all over the world, from the ocean to freshwater to land, and they come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Some of the largest turtle species can weigh over 2,000 pounds and grow up to 7 feet in length. Turtles are ectothermic, meaning they rely on the environment to regulate their body temperature, and they have a unique ability to retract their heads and limbs into their shells for protection. Many species of turtles are herbivores, but some are omnivores or even carnivores. Despite their slow-moving nature, turtles are fascinating creatures that have captured the imaginations of people all over the world.

            <ul>
                <li> Sea turtles lay their eggs in a nest they dig in the sand with their rear flippers. The group of
                    eggs is called a clutch.</li>
                <br>
                <li> Leatherback sea turtles have existed in their current form since the age of the dinosaurs</li>
                <br>
                <li> Some turtles nest in large groups, called "arribadas," Spanish for "arrival." Only the two ridley
                    turtles, Kemp’s ridley and the olive ridley, display this arribada nesting behavior.</li>
                <br>
                <li> Sea turtles are deep divers and can stay underwater for long periods of time.</li>
                <br>
                <li>The sex of sea turtles, like many other turtles, is determined by the temperature in the nest.
                    Cooler incubation temperatures produce male hatchlings and warmer incubation temperatures produce
                    female hatchlings. Temperatures that fluctuate between the two extremes will produce a mix of male
                    and female hatchlings.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Unlike other turtles, sea turtles cannot retract their flippers and head into their shells. Their
                    streamlined shells and large paddle-shaped flippers make them very agile and graceful swimmers.
                </li>

            <p>Turtles have some interesting breeding behaviors. Depending on the species, they may mate in or out of the water. Female turtles often lay their eggs 
                in holes they dig in the sand or soil, and some species even return to the same spot year after year to lay their eggs. The temperature of the eggs 
                during incubation can determine the sex of the offspring, with warmer temperatures resulting in females and cooler temperatures resulting in males. 
                In some cases, turtles may also lay eggs without mating, a process known as parthenogenesis. Interestingly, some species of turtles have been known 
                to store sperm from mating for several years, allowing them to fertilize their eggs even when a mate is not present.</p>
            <p>Female turtles may lay anywhere from a few to several hundred eggs at a time, depending on the species. After laying the eggs, the female will cover 
                them with sand or soil and leave them to incubate on their own.

            </p>
            <p>In many turtle species, the eggs are left to incubate for several weeks or months, depending on the temperature and humidity of the surrounding 
                environment. The hatchlings then emerge from the eggs and must fend for themselves from the moment they hatch.</p>
            <p>In some species of turtles, the male may engage in courtship behavior before mating, such as head bobbing, biting, or circling the female. Some
                 males may also emit a distinctive vocalization to attract females.</p>
            <p>Some species of turtles are highly endangered due to habitat loss and poaching, which can have a devastating impact on their breeding populations. 
                Conservation efforts are underway to protect turtle species and ensure their survival for future generations.</p>
